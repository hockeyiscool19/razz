# Razz

# Design And Functionality

The goal of this code is be able to use my Rasberry Pi similar to Alexa. This will be hooked up at first to my local microphone and then hopefully to a Rasberry Pi mic. The app will listen for the key word "Rasberry: play x song." This key word will trigger my Rasberry Pi to connect to my Spotify through the Spotify API.

# Challenges

1. I have no idea what I am doing in C++. 
2. Configuring my Rasberry Pi.
3. Connecting my program to a mic.
4. Connecting C++ to Spotify. 
5. Recognizing my voice command to play a song.
